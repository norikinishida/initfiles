# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind s split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind v split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind -r S select-layout even-vertical
bind -r V select-layout even-horizontal

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind -r H resize-pane -L 1
bind -r J resize-pane -D 1
bind -r K resize-pane -U 1
bind -r L resize-pane -R 1

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

# vi-style controls for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# Prefix
set-option -g prefix C-k

# status bar
set -g status-interval 10
set -g status-bg 4
setw -g window-status-current-fg black
setw -g window-status-current-bg white
setw -g window-status-current-attr bright

# go to the current directory when opening/splitting panes 
bind c new-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'
# bind '"' split-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'
